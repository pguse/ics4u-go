# Using Structs in Go

In Visual Studio Code, create a folder called **Structs** and then open it. Now open a new Terminal window.

## Exercises

Modify the starter code called **pointFunctions.go**, in completing the following exercises.

## 10-0:  Distance

Complete the following function, that returns the **distance between two points**.

```go
func distance(p1, p2 Point) float64 {
	return 0.0
}
```

## 10-1:  Slope

Complete the following function, that returns the **slope of a line passing through two points**.

```go
func slope(p1, p2 Point) float64 {
	return 0.0
}
```

Modify the starter code called **fractionMethods.go**, in completing the following exercises.

## 10-2:  Divide

Complete the following method, that returns the **quotient** of **f / f1**, where **f** and **f1** are of type **Fraction**.

```go
func (f Fraction) Div(f1 Fraction) Fraction {
	return Fraction{}
}
```

## 10-3:  Add

Complete the following method, that returns the **sum** of **f + f1**, where **f** and **f1** are of type **Fraction**.

```go
func (f Fraction) Add(f1 Fraction) Fraction {
	return Fraction{}
}
```

## 10-4:  Subtract

Complete the following method, that returns the **difference** of **f - f1**, where **f** and **f1** are of type **Fraction**.

```go
func (f Fraction) Subt(f1 Fraction) Fraction {
	return Fraction{}
}
```
